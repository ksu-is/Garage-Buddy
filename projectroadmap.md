Sprint 1:
- [x] Have an approved project topic.
- [x] Establish a Github account and joined the class organization (KSU-IS) in Github by accepting the invite email.
- [x] Be associated with ownership of a code repository in our Github organization. If on a team, ensure each has Owner or Maintainer Role.
- [x] Have edited and committed changes in a readme.md file in the repository in the Github organization. The commits should show in Github.

Final Part:
- [ ] Answer questions below (see "Final Project Questions")
- [ ] Prepare final presentation

- [ ] Post a screenshot & link it
- [ ] Upload PPT here

Final Project Questions
Project Presentations in Teams -> present in Teams Project Presentations channel (Project Presentations or Projects if there is no Project Presentations channel).
Present your project. To do so, follow these instructions. Be sure to record, as I may not see your presentation otherwise, and you will not get credit for it. If you forget, re-schedule and do it again:
1) Schedule a meeting in this channel. Allocate 10 minutes for yourself. Make sure you do not overlap anyone else. You can schedule anytime between the last day of class and the last day of finals.
2) At the scheduled time, login, turn on recording, and introduce your project (1-2 minutes)


            • What was the idea?

            • What source code/tutorials did you find?


3) How did your project develop?


            • What surprised you? How did the scope change? Why?

            • What roadblocks did you face? How did you overcome them? (show the code and changes you made to fix it)

4) Run it/Show the code.


            • Does it run? Show what it can do even if it cannot run.

            • What would you do next?

When you finish, end the recording and let it upload for a minute or two before closing Teams. That's it. Remember, you may need to practice in advance to ensure your Teams setup is ready for presenting. Learn how to share your screen so you can show your code and any PPTs you develop.
